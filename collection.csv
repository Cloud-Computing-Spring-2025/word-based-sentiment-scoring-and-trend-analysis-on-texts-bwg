1,The African orphan boy,1852,"THE AFRICAN ORPHAN BOY.



THE AFRICAN ORPHAN BOY.

FAR away in one of the valleys of South Africa, there lived a heathen family. They were rich in flocks and herds. For many years they sowed the ground, and gathered the fruits in peace. At some distance from this family dwelt a warlike tribe called Zoolahs, which often formed into bands and invaded the country road. In these attacks they used first to kill the men, and then they carried off the cattle, broke down the huts, and set fire to the cornfields.

One day these savage men rushed into the valley where this African family lived. They slew the father, and left the mother and her little son Mossetse by the side of the ruins of their hut. The widow and her child sat down to weep; their home was gone, their best earthly friend was slain, and all they had in the world was torn from them by their wicked foes. Poor heathen woman! she knew not that God saw her and her child, as he saw Hagar and Ishmael in the desert. Nor did she know that he was a Father to the fatherless, and a husband to the widow. No gospel had ever reached her dark mind, nor had she been taught to bend her knees in prayer. The widow took a sharp stick, and as she was too ill to seek for food, she gave it to her little boy, and sent him to dig up roots, and to collect a kind of grass, which was at that time ripe. The grass was so hard and coarse that even the cattle would scarcely eat it; but as it yielded a few handfuls of grain, she ground it between two stones, and formed it into ""grass-bread.""

Soon the health of the poor widow began to fail; for weeks passed away, and no one came to their help. In her sadness she thought, who would provide for her little boy when she was dead. She used the little strength she had to make a large quantity of grass-bread, that she might have a supply if she grew worse, or for her orphan child if she were taken from him by death.

Some days after she had made this supply of food, she lay in the ruins of her hut unable to move; an old skin was her only covering when the cold shiverings of a fever came over her; and Mossetse, still too young to know his mother's danger, said to himself, ""Why does not my mother sit with me in the bright beams of the sun, as she used to do?"" One day she called him in a feeble voice, ""My child, go; some one finding thee will have pity on thee, and take thee up. Leave me, I am nearly dead. For two days thou hast not eaten any thing. Follow yon footpath which crosses the valley; some one will surely meet thee."" Little Mossetse was afraid, and said to his dying mother, ""Do not speak so; it makes me cry. No, you will soon be well, and I shall no longer be hungry."" While she again spoke to him, she died; but he knew it not. In his distress, he crept under the old skin that covered his mother. Three days passed away, and he wondered why she slept so long. He called to her, but she made no answer. In his distress, he went and sat down at the door of the hut, when an African woman passing by, stopped to look at the lonely child, and went into the hut. She then told Mossetse that his mother was dead. ""Dead!"" he did not know what it meant: but when he was made to understand that his mother would not speak or move again, sorrow filled his young heart; while the woman coldly turned away, and left him alone in his misery.

All night he sat in the desert by the side of the dead body of his mother: when the morning came, he thought he would go along the narrow path of which she spoke. He walked for some hours in it, when he came to a place where a native was at work. Mossetse sat down a little way off though he spoke not a word. The man looked at him, and seeing that he was faint, tired, and covered with dust, he drew near, and then offered to take the little wanderer to a stream of water, to wash and refresh his limbs. At the sight of the water the boy cried aloud, ""Oh, do not drown me; I will be your servant; I can take care of your kids."" To calm his distress, the kind stranger called his own children to play with him, while he hastened to fetch some bread and milk. When it was brought, the poor orphan had been so long without either eating or drinking, that the first draught of milk caused him to utter a cry, and he had scarcely power to eat the bread. In a little time, however, he gained strength, and became as one of the family of his kind protector.

But the sorrows of the orphan had not come to an end. The savage invaders now threatened to attack the place where he had found a new home. And as his foster-father saw that they must all hasten away, he told Mossetse to flee to the huts of some chiefs who were able to protect and provide for him. ""I love you as my own child,"" said the kind man; ""but go; I have done for you all that is in my power to do."" He then tied some food around the orphan boy's neck, and hastened to secure his own family by flight.

The child now sat down on the roadside and shed tears. He thought he was forsaken of all. While he was thus weeping, a troop of savage men rushed along the road: they soon overtook Mossetse's kind benefactor, and killed him and all his family. The next morning all that remained of them were a few scattered bones; for the savages had not only killed them, but had feasted on their bodies. If Mossetse had been with them, he would have been slain and eaten too.

Night came on, and the poor boy crept under a bush. When the morning dawned he came forth, and not knowing what to do or whither to go, he walked on till he came to a mountain. In this mountain he found a cave or opening in the side, and here he made his dreary home. How sad and desolate was now his state. His sheepskin was worn and torn; the cave was his dwelling; wild berries and roots were his food; and at night his rest was broken by the fierce howlings of wild beasts. No fire, no covering, no friend, no companion was possessed by poor little Mossetse. Week after week, and month after month passed away, until he had lived in the cave for more than a year.

Want at length forced him to leave his mountain cave. He set out, not knowing whither he went; but after walking many weary miles, he came to the huts of some Africans, who received him in a friendly way, and among them he took up his abode.

Mossetse grew up like the rest of the heathen, in sin and ignorance; he was without God in this world, and without hope of the world to come. Years passed away, and at last some missionaries came to this spot. On one occasion, when the missionary was showing that God is the preserver of men, Mossetse rose from the ground, and said, ""It is true: the heavenly Father, of whom I now learn, watched over me and directed my steps. He gave me that kind friend who fed me. He preserved me from death in my cave in the mountains. What have I done for God, who loved me so much? Why has he not permitted me to perish? I am an ear of corn left standing in the midst of a field stricken with hail. Was I not the companion of the children who were killed? Did I not sleep with them beneath the same cloak? And was I not to have slept with them again on the night in which they perished? I live by a miracle. God said, 'Mossetse shall live.' I was to live to know Him who caused me to live. From this time I wish to be his; I can be no other's.""

From that day he ceased to live as a heathen; and after his sincerity had been proved for three years, he was publicly admitted to the church. ""It was,"" says a missionary, ""the finest scene I have beheld in Africa. Placed in the midst of many hundreds of natives, in the presence of the chief of the tribe, his eyes beaming with joy, he thus spoke: 'What love is that of Jesus! Mossetse, is it indeed true that thou art a Christian? The smallest worm among the worms called men, how hast thou been remembered of God! I see nothing good in me; all has been spoiled by my ingratitude; my sins have nailed the Saviour on the cross. I renounce the world with joy. I have taken my shield; see, I stand ready to combat for Jesus, who has loved me so much. Now he shall be my King, my sole good, and my portion.' As he spoke, all who stood around listened with surprise at his words.""

Mossetse received the name of Moses at his baptism, which name he took to remind him of the deliverances God had wrought on his behalf.

A few days after this, the missionary asked him if he did not sometimes wish to run in the ways of sin. ""I do not know,"" said he, ""how a man who had received a stab in his breast from a sword, should desire to be wounded a second time. I have suffered too much from the agony of my conscience to seek to renew it; and I find that the peace which I enjoy is of far greater value than the vanities which I have had to give up.""

Little orphan children who read this account, should take comfort and be encouraged. They may say with king David, ""When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up."" The same God who watched over the orphan boy in heathen Africa, has preserved them; and if they put their trust in him, he will be their Father and Friend all their days on earth. And if, like Mossetse, they repent of sin, and believe in Jesus as their Saviour, they shall for ever dwell with him in heaven.

This little account also shows the value of Christian missions. The African orphan would not have known who had saved him in all his dangers, if the missionaries had not been sent to preach the gospel in his land. In sin he would have lived, and without hope he would have died. But he heard of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit blessed to his soul what he heard. Happy Mossetse! may many more of your sable brethren be brought to love the Saviour of sinners; and may those children in Christian lands who help to send the gospel to the heathen, learn to know the value of that gospel themselves."

THE AFRICAN WOMAN.

LITTLEMary was sitting at the window with her mother. She saw a poor old African woman go by. Omother, said she, I do not love that woman at all! Why not, Mary? Because she is black; I do not like anybody that is black. Her mother said, Mary, Mary, I am sorry to hear you talk so. It is foolish, it is wicked.

Mary looked very sober. Then she said, Why is it wicked, mother? My dear, it is wrong, because God has told us to love everybody in the world. God made that poor woman as well as you. I will call her in to see you.

Mary was frightened. She said, O no, mother, if you please, do not call her in. Yes, my dear, I wish to teach you a lesson. Then she raised the window, and asked the old woman to come in. Mary's mother said, Good woman, what do you think of this little girl? She is a dear little miss, madam: may I give her a peace? Then she took a peach out of her basket, and gave it to Mary. The little girl felt very much ashamed, and hung down her head.

The old woman then said, Once I had three little girls, but they are all dead. The Lord knows what is best. And the tears came into her eyes. Mary was ready to weep too. Then Mrs. Ewing gave the woman some work to do; for she knew her very well.

After the woman had gone, Mary said, Mother, I am sorry for being so foolish and naughty; I will not hate black people any more. Her mother said, My dear, you should not hate any of God's creatures. All men and women are made of one blood. All are brethren. This poor African woman was brought to America when she was young. Now she is old, and very poor. Besides, she is a pious woman, and I am sure Christ lovesher. You ought to love her too, and to do her all the good you can. Mary said nothing, but after all she felt some dislike to poor Patty.

Not long after Mary was very sick. She was in bed several weeks.

One morning the old African woman knocked at the door, and said, Mrs. Ewing, where is little Miss Mary? I never see her going by to school.

Then Mrs. Ewing took her into the chamber where Marylay sick. Old Patty was very sorry.

She came and nursed Mary for seven days and nights. And when the little girl got well, she said,

Mother, I will never hate anybody again for having a dark skin. Poor Patty is a great deal better than I am.

THE SWAN.

THE Swan is a very beautiful bird. It is generally white, though a black swan has been discovered in Australia. It is not very often seen in this country. It was brought from Asia and Eastern Europe into England--from whence, most probably, a few specimens have been introduced into this country. The Swan is very graceful in the water, but on land it is an awkward waddler.

THE COOT.

THE Coot is generally found in large sheets of water, particularly if shaded by trees. The nest is a mass of flags, reeds, and grass, usually at the water's edge, but sometimes actually in the water. The Coot's eggs are generally seven in number. They are of a greenish-white, spotted.

THE DABCHICK.

THE Dabchick is a very timid bird, and when alarmed instantly dives, after which it is useless to look after the bird. It is easily domesticated, and is often seen placed as an ornament to ponds, where it swims about very merrily, and seems to enjoy a game of hide and seek with any one who is attempting to watch its movements.

THE TEAL.

THE Teal is the smallest of the ducks. The Green-winged Teal is the American. It feeds on fresh-water insects, seeds, and aquatic plants. When fat it is considered a great luxury. It is almost always seen on well furnished tables. It generally feeds at night. It flies very swiftly, and utters a whistling cry.

THE GOOSE.

THE Goose is a very common bird. In Lincolnshire, England, enormous flocks are bred, containing from two to ten thousand each. They are subjected to the plucking of their wing-feathers periodically, in order to supply the demand for quills.

THE OYSTER CATCHER.

THE Oyster Catcher feeds generally on shell-fish, oysters, limpets, &c. He detaches them from the rocks to which they are fastened, and opens them with his long, stout bill. The head, neck, and body are black. It lays two olive-brown eggs, spotted with black.

4,The little coat,1821,"No. 9. THE LITTLE COAT: BY REV. SYLVESTER JUDD, OF AUGUSTA, MAINE.

The season of the year has arrived, when our mothers, like Hannah of old, are making for their children little coats.

Dress, that necessary appendage of the body, constitutes no inconspicuous feature of our earthly life. Wherewithal shall we clothed? was a Gentilian question of old, and in this we are all Gentiles still. The dress becomes an exponent of the mind, which, in its turn, is more or less tinged by what we wear.

Children are easily taught to love dress; and they set just about that value on it, which their parents and friends do in their behalf. I have seen children vain of their dresses, but they were not half so vain as their mothers were for them. Some mothers try exceedingly to awaken, in their very young children, a sensibility to dress, and so attach them to colors and finery. Pains are taken to impress it upon the mind of the child, that he has something pretty, and he soon learns to discriminate in such matters. This passion, too, sometimes takes a precedence of a love of goodness, a love of the truly beautiful, a love of nature and God; and, once established, it assumes a haughty sway over the soul. Our youths, some of them, become sadly enslaved in this vice.

When I see young persons devoted to dress, studious of appearances, aiming at effect more by what is external, than internal, it is obvious to reflect that their mothers once made them little coats.

In like manner, also, when I see a child imitating the example, yielding to the impress, carrying out the principles, or developing the spirit of a parent, I am reminded that the mother once made him a little coat.

We are permitted, then, to leave the letter of the text, and follow out what it may suggest in the spirit.

Clothing, in the Scripture, is frequently mentioned in a figurative or spiritual sense. We are said to be clothed with righteousness, clothed with shame, &c. He that overcometh, shall be clothed in white. The clothing stands for the virtues or vices with which we may suppose a man to be invested. St. Paul desires to be clothed upon with his house, which is from above; he desires to exhibit the fair and beautiful image of a perfect Christian; that his spirit and character may be, as it were, dressed in heavenly love.

The text, and the season of the year, remind me then of other things than the mere working of raw materials; or rather this outward act suggests certain things in the inward life.

Let me then say a brief word to the parents.

You are clothing your children for honor and for shame, for righteousness or for waywardness; you are making for them little coats which they must wear a long while; you are fitting that garment of white, in which they shall shine forever in the kingdom of God; or that of desolation, in which the sinful soul shall be perpetually folded.

I meet a man in the streets, literally clothed in rags, clothed, also, with manifold tokens of a depraved life; I asked, did not his mother, when he was young, make him a little coat?

When I see a person clothed, as the Scripture has it, in humility, entertaining a modest sense of himself, and a just estimate of others; unostentatiously attaching himself to great principles, meekly waiting the will of God, reverent of truth, and supple to goodness, I am allowed to conceive that when he was young, his mother made for him a little coat.

These coats seem to last a long time; though you renew them, as Hannah did, year by year, the pattern and effect are about the same.

These clothes they shall wear when you are dead; they shall wear them in distant lands; that old family style shall show itself in many places and times. What sort of clothes are you making for your children? You are at some expense and pains in this matter. You give a good deal of thought to the garb of your household, but how after all will they appear? Is their vesture wisdom or folly? Is it the true beauty of goodness, or a poor imitation from the drapers?

They that overcome, the same shall be clothed in white raiment.

Are you educating your children to overcome the world, its evil ways, its pernicious usages; to overcome the fear of man, and servility to gain; to overcome the spirit of hatred, that in nations, in society, and among individuals, so works, everywhere corrupting the morals, as well as captivating the tastes of our young people? then are you dressing your children to take their places in the snowy and lustrous throng that compose the throne of the Most High. We read of one who was cast out from a certain place, because he had not on a suitable garment. God is even now gathering his elect from the four quarters of the earth; he calls the great and the good, the truthful and earnest to a common festival of love. Are you making a little coat for your son, that he may also join the company of those who are ushering in the kingdom of God here, and hope to enjoy its rewards hereafter?

Paul, speaking of the heavenly vesture, uses this expression: ""If so being clothed, we shall not be found naked."" ""We would not be unclothed,"" he adds. The spirit is as susceptible of clothing as the flesh, and you all help to furnish those garments. Not more do persons differ in one than the other; and you shall find characters as miserable and as rudely clad as you ever saw bodies. It is not a matter of refined speculation, but of simple gospel teaching, when I say that the inward makes a part of its garb from the outward; that our souls are clad by what is about us.

From all things, from the general tone of society, from the prevalent maxims of the age, from the place where we are reared, from our sabbaths, our ministers, our creeds, and especially from our household circumstances, from our fathers and mothers, we all derive an inward clothing. The spirit rarely goes nude a long time; if it be not folded in beauty, it soon takes up with the vestment of deformity.

But what more immediately concerns us: we are clothing one another; and parents are clothing their children. Your words, your acts go to make up this clothing. Something you did yesterday, becomes part of a garment which your child must wear many years.

You are not a little troubled about the material clothing of your children; are you never ashamed of their moral clothing? If parents, take the world through, would spend half as much time dressing the minds as they do the bodies of their children, I am sure they would look a great deal better.

Washington, for whom I have sincere reverence, not, however, by reason of his military deeds, was clothed with dignity; he was folded in true greatness as a vesture; virtue, as a robe of white linen, encompassed him: now, Washington's mother, if my recollection be right, when he was a boy, made him a little coat; and that coat, that moral coat, growing with his growth, and conforming to his stature, he wore during all his life.

A young man was recently put to death in one of our states. He lay in prison, clothed, as the papers said, in disgrace, wrapped in ignominy--the tokens of guilt and vice he wore about him as a garment. Now, it may be, though I know nothing about it, yet I have no doubt, if the case were investigated, we should find that his mother, or some one, when he was a boy, made him that same little coat.

Young mother, a naked spirit comes to your hands, as well as a naked body. You have prepared clothing for the last, shall the first go unendued, picking up what it may wear at haphazard? Is the body of your child all you have thought about? It is yours to dress a new, living spirit; to cut out and make for it celestial attire: it is yours to give it the robe of immortality.

Clothed with immortality, is a Scripture phrase. Immortality here does not seem to announce the fact of continued existence. We are immortal by nature; but that immortality by grace is quite another thing; it denotes purity, goodness, Christ-likeness; it signifies a predominance of the superior propensities, a supply of evangelical virtues. It is the imperishable vesture of virtue; it is the evergreen leaf of the tree that grows by the river of God.

This clothing of immortality we begin to put on this side of the grave; we wear it through life; we go, as it were, ready dressed to heaven. Have you inquired what the fashion of the kingdom of God is? Have you, while getting apparel that the moth and rust must so soon corrupt, have you thought of this durable, this beautiful fabric of the gospel? You would not bring your children to church, or send them to school, without some care of their clothes; they may soon die, and enter upon scenes of another world--are you fitting them to appear suitably in that glorious presence?

Our earthly clothing, how is it abridged, how quickly does it come to nothing! A simple strip of plain cloth suffices for our dissolving bodies at last. Our many colored wardrobe, our varied suits, our multiplied pieces are laid aside, they are hung up as momentoes, they are dispersed into other hands, made over for other uses. The clothing of the spirit is not so easily dropped; it cleaves to us in sickness and in health, in life and in death, in time and in eternity. See to it then, what sort of coats you are making for your children.

In that day, who would be found naked? who would be found void of the righteousness of Christ, unprotected by the garments of salvation? who would appear in the presence of angels and the redeemed, in the ugliness of sin and vice?

The sinner is unclothed, notwithstanding all the tailor may do for him; he is poor, and blind, and naked, for all he may say he is rich, and has need of nothing. The shame of his nakedness appears; there are multitudes in heaven and on earth who see it; his deformity can not be hidden. Not the long robes of the Pharisee, not the broidered work of a backslidden people can save them from exposure. The spirit of a man and of a people shows through the dress, and is seen farther. Our vices sully the costliest robes. A beautiful garment but exposes, in stronger contrast, the hidden turpitude of the wearer. Jerusalem is exhorted, in one instance, to put on her beautiful garments. Our country, my friends, both in its civil and ecclesiastical position, seems to be losing its beautiful garments. Where is our humanity, where our liberty, where our justice? where is that true greatness to which we seem to be destined? where those robes of solid worth and widely accredited virtue, in which we might have sat even as a queen upon the great white throne of nations? Mothers, beware what coats you make for your children. Through these children we hope our land will reappear in her beautiful garments; and thereby those vices, sins, and evils that so disfigure and rend our attire will be abandoned.

The spiritual clothing of some people seems imperfect; they are half clad, or redundantly clad, or unsuitably clad. See how bigotry dresses up its people; and ostentation, and sectarianism, and formality! See hypocrisy vainly dodging beneath its disguises; see the mantle of self-righteousness conspicuously bestowed upon the shoulders! Where shall we find the seamless robe of the Saviour; where gracefully put the clean, white robe of the saints?

Mothers, think of these things, I say, then, in no unkind, no cynical temper. Your older children are even now wearing coats you made for them years ago. Do you like them? Is it a garment of praise; is it a robe of righteousness; is it seemly and fitting for the kingdom of God? Have they a character which you wish them to wear forever?

But the child whom you are dressing for almost the first time, for whom you are making his first little coat, what shall he be?

Make the little coat, O mother! But remember, the child must wear it a long time; make it so that it will fit him in trial, in change, in adversity; make it so that it will be no disgrace to him before God or his fellow men, to be seen in it; so make it that it will be to him a robe of dignity and esteem in the world, and a robe spotless and bright in the kingdom of heaven forever.

""HIS MOTHER MADE HIM A LITTLE COAT.""

Without a seam of sin;

The outward part of humility,

And charity within.

Embracing all mankind;

The buttons choose of burnished truth,

The emblem of the mind.

4.

Firmness a collar make,

All evil to resist,

Broad and expansive on the breast.

The needy to assist.

5.

Engirdle it around

With conscientiousness,

That every word may wisdom prove,

And every action bless.

Make it of richest dye,

Fit for the marriage feast;

Then at the supper of the Lamb

He'll be a welcome guest.

7.

No varying fashion's change

Its fitness can impair;

No moth its texture can destroy,

Or mar its beauty rare.

8.

'T will be a fitting garb

To wear 'mid toils of earth;

'T will be a bright and glorious robe

At its immortal birth.

9.

Then, mother, ceaseless work,

This garment to prepare,

In hope you may the heavenly bliss

Of a blest servant share.
