1,The African orphan boy,1852,"THE AFRICAN ORPHAN BOY.    THE AFRICAN ORPHAN BOY.  FAR away in one of the valleys of South Africa, there lived a heathen family. They were rich in flocks and herds. For many years they sowed the ground, and gathered the fruits in peace. At some distance from this family dwelt a warlike tribe called Zoolahs, which often formed into bands and invaded the country road. In these attacks they used first to kill the men, and then they carried off the cattle, broke down the huts, and set fire to the cornfields.  One day these savage men rushed into the valley where this African family lived. They slew the father, and left the mother and her little son Mossetse by the side of the ruins of their hut. The widow and her child sat down to weep; their home was gone, their best earthly friend was slain, and all they had in the world was torn from them by their wicked foes. Poor heathen woman! she knew not that God saw her and her child, as he saw Hagar and Ishmael in the desert. Nor did she know that he was a Father to the fatherless, and a husband to the widow. No gospel had ever reached her dark mind, nor had she been taught to bend her knees in prayer. The widow took a sharp stick, and as she was too ill to seek for food, she gave it to her little boy, and sent him to dig up roots, and to collect a kind of grass, which was at that time ripe. The grass was so hard and coarse that even the cattle would scarcely eat it; but as it yielded a few handfuls of grain, she ground it between two stones, and formed it into ""grass-bread.""  Soon the health of the poor widow began to fail; for weeks passed away, and no one came to their help. In her sadness she thought, who would provide for her little boy when she was dead. She used the little strength she had to make a large quantity of grass-bread, that she might have a supply if she grew worse, or for her orphan child if she were taken from him by death.  Some days after she had made this supply of food, she lay in the ruins of her hut unable to move; an old skin was her only covering when the cold shiverings of a fever came over her; and Mossetse, still too young to know his mother's danger, said to himself, ""Why does not my mother sit with me in the bright beams of the sun, as she used to do?"" One day she called him in a feeble voice, ""My child, go; some one finding thee will have pity on thee, and take thee up. Leave me, I am nearly dead. For two days thou hast not eaten any thing. Follow yon footpath which crosses the valley; some one will surely meet thee."" Little Mossetse was afraid, and said to his dying mother, ""Do not speak so; it makes me cry. No, you will soon be well, and I shall no longer be hungry."" While she again spoke to him, she died; but he knew it not. In his distress, he crept under the old skin that covered his mother. Three days passed away, and he wondered why she slept so long. He called to her, but she made no answer. In his distress, he went and sat down at the door of the hut, when an African woman passing by, stopped to look at the lonely child, and went into the hut. She then told Mossetse that his mother was dead. ""Dead!"" he did not know what it meant: but when he was made to understand that his mother would not speak or move again, sorrow filled his young heart; while the woman coldly turned away, and left him alone in his misery.  All night he sat in the desert by the side of the dead body of his mother: when the morning came, he thought he would go along the narrow path of which she spoke. He walked for some hours in it, when he came to a place where a native was at work. Mossetse sat down a little way off though he spoke not a word. The man looked at him, and seeing that he was faint, tired, and covered with dust, he drew near, and then offered to take the little wanderer to a stream of water, to wash and refresh his limbs. At the sight of the water the boy cried aloud, ""Oh, do not drown me; I will be your servant; I can take care of your kids."" To calm his distress, the kind stranger called his own children to play with him, while he hastened to fetch some bread and milk. When it was brought, the poor orphan had been so long without either eating or drinking, that the first draught of milk caused him to utter a cry, and he had scarcely power to eat the bread. In a little time, however, he gained strength, and became as one of the family of his kind protector.  But the sorrows of the orphan had not come to an end. The savage invaders now threatened to attack the place where he had found a new home. And as his foster-father saw that they must all hasten away, he told Mossetse to flee to the huts of some chiefs who were able to protect and provide for him. ""I love you as my own child,"" said the kind man; ""but go; I have done for you all that is in my power to do."" He then tied some food around the orphan boy's neck, and hastened to secure his own family by flight.  The child now sat down on the roadside and shed tears. He thought he was forsaken of all. While he was thus weeping, a troop of savage men rushed along the road: they soon overtook Mossetse's kind benefactor, and killed him and all his family. The next morning all that remained of them were a few scattered bones; for the savages had not only killed them, but had feasted on their bodies. If Mossetse had been with them, he would have been slain and eaten too.  Night came on, and the poor boy crept under a bush. When the morning dawned he came forth, and not knowing what to do or whither to go, he walked on till he came to a mountain. In this mountain he found a cave or opening in the side, and here he made his dreary home. How sad and desolate was now his state. His sheepskin was worn and torn; the cave was his dwelling; wild berries and roots were his food; and at night his rest was broken by the fierce howlings of wild beasts. No fire, no covering, no friend, no companion was possessed by poor little Mossetse. Week after week, and month after month passed away, until he had lived in the cave for more than a year.  Want at length forced him to leave his mountain cave. He set out, not knowing whither he went; but after walking many weary miles, he came to the huts of some Africans, who received him in a friendly way, and among them he took up his abode.  Mossetse grew up like the rest of the heathen, in sin and ignorance; he was without God in this world, and without hope of the world to come. Years passed away, and at last some missionaries came to this spot. On one occasion, when the missionary was showing that God is the preserver of men, Mossetse rose from the ground, and said, ""It is true: the heavenly Father, of whom I now learn, watched over me and directed my steps. He gave me that kind friend who fed me. He preserved me from death in my cave in the mountains. What have I done for God, who loved me so much? Why has he not permitted me to perish? I am an ear of corn left standing in the midst of a field stricken with hail. Was I not the companion of the children who were killed? Did I not sleep with them beneath the same cloak? And was I not to have slept with them again on the night in which they perished? I live by a miracle. God said, 'Mossetse shall live.' I was to live to know Him who caused me to live. From this time I wish to be his; I can be no other's.""  From that day he ceased to live as a heathen; and after his sincerity had been proved for three years, he was publicly admitted to the church. ""It was,"" says a missionary, ""the finest scene I have beheld in Africa. Placed in the midst of many hundreds of natives, in the presence of the chief of the tribe, his eyes beaming with joy, he thus spoke: 'What love is that of Jesus! Mossetse, is it indeed true that thou art a Christian? The smallest worm among the worms called men, how hast thou been remembered of God! I see nothing good in me; all has been spoiled by my ingratitude; my sins have nailed the Saviour on the cross. I renounce the world with joy. I have taken my shield; see, I stand ready to combat for Jesus, who has loved me so much. Now he shall be my King, my sole good, and my portion.' As he spoke, all who stood around listened with surprise at his words.""  Mossetse received the name of Moses at his baptism, which name he took to remind him of the deliverances God had wrought on his behalf.  A few days after this, the missionary asked him if he did not sometimes wish to run in the ways of sin. ""I do not know,"" said he, ""how a man who had received a stab in his breast from a sword, should desire to be wounded a second time. I have suffered too much from the agony of my conscience to seek to renew it; and I find that the peace which I enjoy is of far greater value than the vanities which I have had to give up.""  Little orphan children who read this account, should take comfort and be encouraged. They may say with king David, ""When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up."" The same God who watched over the orphan boy in heathen Africa, has preserved them; and if they put their trust in him, he will be their Father and Friend all their days on earth. And if, like Mossetse, they repent of sin, and believe in Jesus as their Saviour, they shall for ever dwell with him in heaven.  This little account also shows the value of Christian missions. The African orphan would not have known who had saved him in all his dangers, if the missionaries had not been sent to preach the gospel in his land. In sin he would have lived, and without hope he would have died. But he heard of Jesus, and the Holy Spirit blessed to his soul what he heard. Happy Mossetse! may many more of your sable brethren be brought to love the Saviour of sinners; and may those children in Christian lands who help to send the gospel to the heathen, learn to know the value of that gospel themselves."
2,The African woman,1857,"THE AFRICAN WOMAN. A child praying at her bedside.  The Lucile Clarke MEMORIAL Children's Library    THE AFRICAN WOMAN.  LITTLEMary was sitting at the window with her mother. She saw a poor old African woman go by. Omother, said she, I do not love that woman at all! Why not, Mary? Because she is black; I do not like anybody that is black. Her mother said, Mary, Mary, I am sorry to hear you talk so. It is foolish, it is wicked.  Mary looked very sober. Then she said, Why is it wicked, mother? My dear, it is wrong, because God has told us to love everybody in the world. God made that poor woman as well as you. I will call her in to see you.  Mary was frightened. She said, O no, mother, if you please, do not call her in. Yes, my dear, I wish to teach you a lesson. Then she raised the window, and asked the old woman to come in. Mary's mother said, Good woman, what do you think of this little girl? She is a dear little miss, madam: may I give her a peace? Then she took a peach out of her basket, and gave it to Mary. The little girl felt very much ashamed, and hung down her head.  The old woman then said, Once I had three little girls, but they are all dead. The Lord knows what is best. And the tears came into her eyes. Mary was ready to weep too. Then Mrs. Ewing gave the woman some work to do; for she knew her very well.  After the woman had gone, Mary said, Mother, I am sorry for being so foolish and naughty; I will not hate black people any more. Her mother said, My dear, you should not hate any of God's creatures. All men and women are made of one blood. All are brethren. This poor African woman was brought to America when she was young. Now she is old, and very poor. Besides, she is a pious woman, and I am sure Christ lovesher. You ought to love her too, and to do her all the good you can. Mary said nothing, but after all she felt some dislike to poor Patty.  Not long after Mary was very sick. She was in bed several weeks.  One morning the old African woman knocked at the door, and said, Mrs. Ewing, where is little Miss Mary? I never see her going by to school.  Then Mrs. Ewing took her into the chamber where Marylay sick. Old Patty was very sorry.  She came and nursed Mary for seven days and nights. And when the little girl got well, she said,  Mother, I will never hate anybody again for having a dark skin. Poor Patty is a great deal better than I am.  THE END.

3,Child's book of water birds,1855,"CHILD'S BOOK OF WATER BIRDS.  THE SWAN.  THE Swan is a very beautiful bird. It is generally white, though a black swan has been discovered in Australia. It is not very often seen in this country. It was brought from Asia and Eastern Europe into England--from whence, most probably, a few specimens have been introduced into this country. The Swan is very graceful in the water, but on land it is an awkward waddler.  THE COOT.  THE Coot is generally found in large sheets of water, particularly if shaded by trees. The nest is a mass of flags, reeds, and grass, usually at the water's edge, but sometimes actually in the water. The Coot's eggs are generally seven in number. They are of a greenish-white, spotted.  THE DABCHICK.  THE Dabchick is a very timid bird, and when alarmed instantly dives, after which it is useless to look after the bird. It is easily domesticated, and is often seen placed as an ornament to ponds, where it swims about very merrily, and seems to enjoy a game of hide and seek with any one who is attempting to watch its movements.  THE TEAL.  THE Teal is the smallest of the ducks. The Green-winged Teal is the American. It feeds on fresh-water insects, seeds, and aquatic plants. When fat it is considered a great luxury. It is almost always seen on well furnished tables. It generally feeds at night. It flies very swiftly, and utters a whistling cry.  THE GOOSE.  THE Goose is a very common bird. In Lincolnshire, England, enormous flocks are bred, containing from two to ten thousand each. They are subjected to the plucking of their wing-feathers periodically, in order to supply the demand for quills.  THE OYSTER CATCHER.  THE Oyster Catcher feeds generally on shell-fish, oysters, limpets, &c. He detaches them from the rocks to which they are fastened, and opens them with his long, stout bill. The head, neck, and body are black. It lays two olive-brown eggs, spotted with black.  Adaline Moore  LEAVITT & ALLEN.

4,The little coat,1821,"No. 9. THE LITTLE COAT: BY REV. SYLVESTER JUDD, OF AUGUSTA, MAINE.  The season of the year has arrived, when our mothers, like Hannah of old, are making for their children little coats.  Dress, that necessary appendage of the body, constitutes no inconspicuous feature of our earthly life. Wherewithal shall we clothed? was a Gentilian question of old, and in this we are all Gentiles still. The dress becomes an exponent of the mind, which, in its turn, is more or less tinged by what we wear.  Children are easily taught to love dress; and they set just about that value on it, which their parents and friends do in their behalf. I have seen children vain of their dresses, but they were not half so vain as their mothers were for them. Some mothers try exceedingly to awaken, in their very young children, a sensibility to dress, and so attach them to colors and finery. Pains are taken to impress it upon the mind of the child, that he has something pretty, and he soon learns to discriminate in such matters. This passion, too, sometimes takes a precedence of a love of goodness, a love of the truly beautiful, a love of nature and God; and, once established, it assumes a haughty sway over the soul. Our youths, some of them, become sadly enslaved in this vice.  When I see young persons devoted to dress, studious of appearances, aiming at effect more by what is external, than internal, it is obvious to reflect that their mothers once made them little coats.  In like manner, also, when I see a child imitating the example, yielding to the impress, carrying out the principles, or developing the spirit of a parent, I am reminded that the mother once made him a little coat.  We are permitted, then, to leave the letter of the text, and follow out what it may suggest in the spirit.  Clothing, in the Scripture, is frequently mentioned in a figurative or spiritual sense. We are said to be clothed with righteousness, clothed with shame, &c. He that overcometh, shall be clothed in white. The clothing stands for the virtues or vices with which we may suppose a man to be invested. St. Paul desires to be clothed upon with his house, which is from above; he desires to exhibit the fair and beautiful image of a perfect Christian; that his spirit and character may be, as it were, dressed in heavenly love.  The text, and the season of the year, remind me then of other things than the mere working of raw materials; or rather this outward act suggests certain things in the inward life.  Let me then say a brief word to the parents.  You are clothing your children for honor and for shame, for righteousness or for waywardness; you are making for them little coats which they must wear a long while; you are fitting that garment of white, in which they shall shine forever in the kingdom of God; or that of desolation, in which the sinful soul shall be perpetually folded.  I meet a man in the streets, literally clothed in rags, clothed, also, with manifold tokens of a depraved life; I asked, did not his mother, when he was young, make him a little coat?  When I see a person clothed, as the Scripture has it, in humility, entertaining a modest sense of himself, and a just estimate of others; unostentatiously attaching himself to great principles, meekly waiting the will of God, reverent of truth, and supple to goodness, I am allowed to conceive that when he was young, his mother made for him a little coat.  These coats seem to last a long time; though you renew them, as Hannah did, year by year, the pattern and effect are about the same.  These clothes they shall wear when you are dead; they shall wear them in distant lands; that old family style shall show itself in many places and times. What sort of clothes are you making for your children? You are at some expense and pains in this matter. You give a good deal of thought to the garb of your household, but how after all will they appear? Is their vesture wisdom or folly? Is it the true beauty of goodness, or a poor imitation from the drapers?  They that overcome, the same shall be clothed in white raiment.  Are you educating your children to overcome the world, its evil ways, its pernicious usages; to overcome the fear of man, and servility to gain; to overcome the spirit of hatred, that in nations, in society, and among individuals, so works, everywhere corrupting the morals, as well as captivating the tastes of our young people? then are you dressing your children to take their places in the snowy and lustrous throng that compose the throne of the Most High. We read of one who was cast out from a certain place, because he had not on a suitable garment. God is even now gathering his elect from the four quarters of the earth; he calls the great and the good, the truthful and earnest to a common festival of love. Are you making a little coat for your son, that he may also join the company of those who are ushering in the kingdom of God here, and hope to enjoy its rewards hereafter?  Paul, speaking of the heavenly vesture, uses this expression: ""If so being clothed, we shall not be found naked."" ""We would not be unclothed,"" he adds. The spirit is as susceptible of clothing as the flesh, and you all help to furnish those garments. Not more do persons differ in one than the other; and you shall find characters as miserable and as rudely clad as you ever saw bodies. It is not a matter of refined speculation, but of simple gospel teaching, when I say that the inward makes a part of its garb from the outward; that our souls are clad by what is about us.  From all things, from the general tone of society, from the prevalent maxims of the age, from the place where we are reared, from our sabbaths, our ministers, our creeds, and especially from our household circumstances, from our fathers and mothers, we all derive an inward clothing. The spirit rarely goes nude a long time; if it be not folded in beauty, it soon takes up with the vestment of deformity.  But what more immediately concerns us: we are clothing one another; and parents are clothing their children. Your words, your acts go to make up this clothing. Something you did yesterday, becomes part of a garment which your child must wear many years.  You are not a little troubled about the material clothing of your children; are you never ashamed of their moral clothing? If parents, take the world through, would spend half as much time dressing the minds as they do the bodies of their children, I am sure they would look a great deal better.  Washington, for whom I have sincere reverence, not, however, by reason of his military deeds, was clothed with dignity; he was folded in true greatness as a vesture; virtue, as a robe of white linen, encompassed him: now, Washington's mother, if my recollection be right, when he was a boy, made him a little coat; and that coat, that moral coat, growing with his growth, and conforming to his stature, he wore during all his life.  A young man was recently put to death in one of our states. He lay in prison, clothed, as the papers said, in disgrace, wrapped in ignominy--the tokens of guilt and vice he wore about him as a garment. Now, it may be, though I know nothing about it, yet I have no doubt, if the case were investigated, we should find that his mother, or some one, when he was a boy, made him that same little coat.  Young mother, a naked spirit comes to your hands, as well as a naked body. You have prepared clothing for the last, shall the first go unendued, picking up what it may wear at haphazard? Is the body of your child all you have thought about? It is yours to dress a new, living spirit; to cut out and make for it celestial attire: it is yours to give it the robe of immortality.  Clothed with immortality, is a Scripture phrase. Immortality here does not seem to announce the fact of continued existence. We are immortal by nature; but that immortality by grace is quite another thing; it denotes purity, goodness, Christ-likeness; it signifies a predominance of the superior propensities, a supply of evangelical virtues. It is the imperishable vesture of virtue; it is the evergreen leaf of the tree that grows by the river of God.  This clothing of immortality we begin to put on this side of the grave; we wear it through life; we go, as it were, ready dressed to heaven. Have you inquired what the fashion of the kingdom of God is? Have you, while getting apparel that the moth and rust must so soon corrupt, have you thought of this durable, this beautiful fabric of the gospel? You would not bring your children to church, or send them to school, without some care of their clothes; they may soon die, and enter upon scenes of another world--are you fitting them to appear suitably in that glorious presence?  Our earthly clothing, how is it abridged, how quickly does it come to nothing! A simple strip of plain cloth suffices for our dissolving bodies at last. Our many colored wardrobe, our varied suits, our multiplied pieces are laid aside, they are hung up as momentoes, they are dispersed into other hands, made over for other uses. The clothing of the spirit is not so easily dropped; it cleaves to us in sickness and in health, in life and in death, in time and in eternity. See to it then, what sort of coats you are making for your children.  In that day, who would be found naked? who would be found void of the righteousness of Christ, unprotected by the garments of salvation? who would appear in the presence of angels and the redeemed, in the ugliness of sin and vice?  The sinner is unclothed, notwithstanding all the tailor may do for him; he is poor, and blind, and naked, for all he may say he is rich, and has need of nothing. The shame of his nakedness appears; there are multitudes in heaven and on earth who see it; his deformity can not be hidden. Not the long robes of the Pharisee, not the broidered work of a backslidden people can save them from exposure. The spirit of a man and of a people shows through the dress, and is seen farther. Our vices sully the costliest robes. A beautiful garment but exposes, in stronger contrast, the hidden turpitude of the wearer. Jerusalem is exhorted, in one instance, to put on her beautiful garments. Our country, my friends, both in its civil and ecclesiastical position, seems to be losing its beautiful garments. Where is our humanity, where our liberty, where our justice? where is that true greatness to which we seem to be destined? where those robes of solid worth and widely accredited virtue, in which we might have sat even as a queen upon the great white throne of nations? Mothers, beware what coats you make for your children. Through these children we hope our land will reappear in her beautiful garments; and thereby those vices, sins, and evils that so disfigure and rend our attire will be abandoned.  The spiritual clothing of some people seems imperfect; they are half clad, or redundantly clad, or unsuitably clad. See how bigotry dresses up its people; and ostentation, and sectarianism, and formality! See hypocrisy vainly dodging beneath its disguises; see the mantle of self-righteousness conspicuously bestowed upon the shoulders! Where shall we find the seamless robe of the Saviour; where gracefully put the clean, white robe of the saints?  Mothers, think of these things, I say, then, in no unkind, no cynical temper. Your older children are even now wearing coats you made for them years ago. Do you like them? Is it a garment of praise; is it a robe of righteousness; is it seemly and fitting for the kingdom of God? Have they a character which you wish them to wear forever?  But the child whom you are dressing for almost the first time, for whom you are making his first little coat, what shall he be?  Make the little coat, O mother! But remember, the child must wear it a long time; make it so that it will fit him in trial, in change, in adversity; make it so that it will be no disgrace to him before God or his fellow men, to be seen in it; so make it that it will be to him a robe of dignity and esteem in the world, and a robe spotless and bright in the kingdom of heaven forever.  ""HIS MOTHER MADE HIM A LITTLE COAT.""  1.  Mother, an unclothed soul  Is given to thy arms,  See that the garment which you make  Is wrought with faithful care.  2.  Make it a little coat,  Without a seam of sin;  The outward part of humility,  And charity within.  3.  Add to it sleeves of love,  Embracing all mankind;  The buttons choose of burnished truth,  The emblem of the mind.  4.  Firmness a collar make,  All evil to resist,  Broad and expansive on the breast.  The needy to assist.  5.  Engirdle it around  With conscientiousness,  That every word may wisdom prove,  And every action bless.  6.  Make it of richest dye,  Fit for the marriage feast;  Then at the supper of the Lamb  He'll be a welcome guest.  7.  No varying fashion's change  Its fitness can impair;  No moth its texture can destroy,  Or mar its beauty rare.  8.  'T will be a fitting garb  To wear 'mid toils of earth;  'T will be a bright and glorious robe  At its immortal birth.  9.  Then, mother, ceaseless work,  This garment to prepare,  In hope you may the heavenly bliss  Of a blest servant share.  AMERICAN REFORM TRACT AND BOOK SOCIETY, CINCINNATI, OHIO."
5,A Vindication of the Rights of Woman With Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects,1759,"BRIEF SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT.  M. Wollstonecraft was born in 1759.  Her father was so great a wanderer, that the place of her birth is uncertain; she supposed, however, it was London, or Epping Forest:  at the latter place she spent the first five years of her life.  In early youth she exhibited traces of exquisite sensibility, soundness of understanding, and decision of character; but her father being a despot in his family, and her mother one of his subjects, Mary, derived little benefit from their parental training.  She received no literary instructions but such as were to be had in ordinary day schools.  Before her sixteenth year she became acquainted with Mr. Clare a clergyman, and Miss Frances Blood; the latter, two years older than herself; who possessing good taste and some knowledge of the fine arts, seems to have given the first impulse to the formation of her character.  At the age of nineteen, she left her parents, and resided with a Mrs. Dawson for two years; when she returned to the parental roof to give attention to her mother, whose ill health made her presence necessary.  On the death of her mother, Mary bade a final adieu to her father's house, and became the inmate of F. Blood; thus situated, their intimacy increased, and a strong attachment was reciprocated.  In 1783 she commenced a day school at Newington green, in conjunction with her friend, F. Blood.  At this place she became acquainted with Dr. Price, to whom she became strongly attached; the regard was mutual.  It is said that she became a teacher from motives of benevolence, or rather philanthropy, and during the time she continued in the profession, she gave proof of superior qualification for the performance of its arduous and important duties.  Her friend and coadjutor married and removed to Lisbon, in Portugal, where she died of a pulmonary disease; the symptoms of which were visible before her marriage.  So true was Mary's attachment to her, that she entrusted her school to the care of others, for the purpose of attending Frances in her closing scene.  She aided, as did Dr. Young, in ""Stealing Narcissa a grave.""  Her mind was expanded by this residence in a foreign country, and though clear of religious bigotry before, she took some instructive lessons on the evils of superstition, and intolerance.  On her return she found the school had suffered by her absence, and having previously decided to apply herself to literature, she now resolved to commence.  In 1787 she made, or received, proposals from Johnson, a publisher in London, who was already acquainted with her talents as an author.  During the three subsequent years, she was actively engaged, more in translating, condensing, and compiling, than in the production of original works.  At this time she laboured under much depression of spirits, for the loss of her friend; this rather increased, perhaps, by the publication of ""Mary, a novel,"" which was mostly composed of incidents and reflections connected with their intimacy.  The pecuniary concerns of her father becoming embarrassed, Mary practised a rigid economy in her expenditures, and with her savings was enabled to procure her sisters and brothers situations, to which without her aid, they could not have had access; her father was sustained at length from her funds; she even found means to take under her protection an orphan child.  She had acquired a facility in the arrangement and expression of thoughts, in her avocation of translator, and compiler, which was no doubt of great use to her afterward.  It was not long until she had occasion for them.  The eminent Burke produced his celebrated ""Reflections on the Revolution in France.""  Mary full of sentiments of liberty, and indignant at what she thought subversive of it, seized her pen and produced the first attack upon that famous work. It succeeded well, for though intemperate and contemptuous, it was vehemently and impetuously eloquent; and though Burke was beloved by the enlightened friends of freedom, they were dissatisfied and disgusted with what they deemed an outrage upon it.  It is said that Mary, had not wanted confidence in her own powers before, but the reception this work met from the public, gave her an opportunity of judging what those powers were, in the estimation of others.  It was shortly after this, that she commenced the work to which these remarks are prefixed.  What are its merits will be decided in the judgment of each reader; suffice it to say she appears to have stept forth boldly, and singly, in defence of that half of the human race, which by the usages of all society, whether savage or civilized, have been kept from attaining their proper dignity--their equal rank as rational beings.  It would appear that the disguise used in placing on woman the silken fetters which bribed her into endurance, and even love of slavery, but increased the opposition of our authoress:  she would have had more patience with rude, brute coercion, than with that imposing gallantry, which, while it affects to consider woman as the pride, and ornament of creation, degrades her to a toy--an appendage--a cypher.  The work was much reprehended, and as might well be expected, found its greatest enemies in the pretty soft creatures--the spoiled children of her own sex.  She accomplished it in six weeks.  In 1792 she removed to Paris, where she became acquainted with Gilbert Imlay, of the United States.  And from this acquaintance grew an attachment, which brought the parties together, without legal formalities, to which she objected on account of some family embarrassments, in which he would thereby become involved.  The engagement was however considered by her of the most sacred nature, and they formed the plan of emigrating to America, where they should be enabled to accomplish it.  These were the days of Robespierrean cruelty, and Imlay left Paris for Havre, whither after a time Mary followed him.  They continued to reside there, until he left Havre for London, under pretence of business, and with a promise of rejoining her soon at Paris, which however he did not, but in 1795 sent for her to London.  In the mean time she had become the mother of a female child, whom she called Frances in commemoration of her early friendship.  Before she went to England, she had some gloomy forebodings that the affections of Imlay, had waned, if they were not estranged from her; on her arrival, those forebodings were sorrowfully confirmed. His attentions were too formal and constrained to pass unobserved by her penetration, and though he ascribed his manner, and his absence, to business duties, she saw his affection for her was only something to be remembered.  To use her own expression, ""Love, dear delusion!  Rigorous reason has forced me to resign; and now my rational prospects are blasted, just as I have learned to be contented with rational enjoyments.""  To pretend to depict her misery at this time would be futile; the best idea can be formed of it from the fact that she had planned her own destruction, from which Imlay prevented her.  She conceived the idea of suicide a second time, and threw herself into the Thames; she remained in the water, until consciousness forsook her, but she was taken up and resuscitated.  After divers attempts to revive the affections of Imlay, with sundry explanations and professions on his part, through the lapse of two years, she resolved finally to forgo all hope of reclaiming him, and endeavour to think of him no more in connexion with her future prospects.  In this she succeeded so well, that she afterwards had a private interview with him, which did not produce any painful emotions.  In 1796 she revived or improved an acquaintance which commenced years before with Wm. Godwin, author of ""Political Justice,"" and other works of great notoriety.  Though they had not been favourably impressed with each other on their former acquaintance, they now met under circumstances which permitted a mutual and just appreciation of character.  Their intimacy increased by regular and almost imperceptible degrees.  The partiality they conceived for each other was, according to her biographer, ""In the most refined style of love.  It grew with equal advances in the mind of each. It would have been impossible for the most minute observer to have said who was before, or who after.  One sex did not take the priority which long established custom has awarded it, nor the other overstep that delicacy which is so severely imposed.  Neither party could assume to have been the agent or the patient, the toil-spreader or the prey in the affair.  When in the course of things the disclosure came, there was nothing in a manner for either to disclose to the other.""  Mary lived but a few months after her marriage, and died in child-bed; having given birth to a daughter who is now known to the literary world as Mrs. Shelly, the widow of Percy Bysche Shelly.  We can scarcely avoid regret that one of such splendid talents, and high toned feelings, should, after the former seemed to have been fully developed, and the latter had found an object in whom they might repose, after their eccentric and painful efforts to find a resting place--that such an one should at such a time, be cut off from life is something which we cannot contemplate without feeling regret; we can scarcely repress the murmur that she had not been removed ere clouds darkened her horizon, or that she had remained to witness the brightness and serenity which might have succeeded. But thus it is; we may trace the cause to anti-social arrangements; it is not individuals but society which must change it, and that not by enactments, but by a change in public opinion.  The authoress of the ""Rights of Woman,"" was born April 1759, died September 1797.  That there may be no doubt regarding the facts in this sketch, they are taken from a memoir written by her afflicted husband.  In addition to many kind things he has said of her, (he was not blinded to imperfections in her character) is, that she was ""Lovely in her person, and in the best and most engaging sense feminine in her manners.""   TO  M. TALLEYRAND PERIGORD,  LATE BISHOP OF AUTUN.  Sir:--  Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet, which you have lately published, on National Education, I dedicate this volume to you, the first dedication that I have ever written, to induce you to read it with attention; and, because I think that you will understand me, which I do not suppose many pert witlings will, who may ridicule the arguments they are unable to answer.  But, sir, I carry my respect for your understanding still farther:  so far, that I am confident you will not throw my work aside, and hastily conclude that I am in the wrong because you did not view the subject in the same light yourself.  And pardon my frankness, but I must observe, that you treated it in too cursory a manner, contented to consider it as it had been considered formerly, when the rights of man, not to advert to woman, were trampled on as chimerical.  I call upon you, therefore, now to weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman, and national education; and I call with the firm tone of humanity.  For my arguments, sir, are dictated by a disinterested spirit:  I plead for my sex, not for myself.  Independence I have long considered as the grand blessing of life, the basis of every virtue; and independence I will ever secure by contracting my wants, though I were to live on a barren heath.  It is, then, an affection for the whole human race that makes my pen dart rapidly along to support what I believe to be the cause of virtue:  and the same motive leads me earnestly to wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would advance, instead of retarding, the progress of those glorious principles that give a substance to morality.  My opinion, indeed, respecting the rights and duties of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these simple principles, that I think it scarcely possible, but that some of the enlarged minds who formed your admirable constitution, will coincide with me.  In France, there is undoubtedly a more general diffusion of knowledge than in any part of the European world, and I attribute it, in a great measure, to the social intercourse which has long subsisted between the sexes.  It is true, I utter my sentiments with freedom, that in France the very essence of sensuality has been extracted to regale the voluptuary, and a kind of sentimental lust has prevailed, which, together with the system of duplicity that the whole tenor of their political and civil government taught, have given a sinister sort of sagacity to the French character, properly termed finesse; and a polish of manners that injures the substance, by hunting sincerity out of society.  And, modesty, the fairest garb of virtue has been more grossly insulted in France than even in England, till their women have treated as PRUDISH that attention to decency which brutes instinctively observe.  Manners and morals are so nearly allied, that they have often been confounded; but, though the former should only be the natural reflection of the latter, yet, when various causes have produced factitious and corrupt manners, which are very early caught, morality becomes an empty name.  The personal reserve, and sacred respect for cleanliness and delicacy in domestic life, which French women almost despise, are the graceful pillars of modesty; but, far from despising them, if the pure flame of patriotism have reached their bosoms, they should labour to improve the morals of their fellow-citizens, by teaching men, not only to respect modesty in women, but to acquire it themselves, as the only way to merit their esteem.  Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge, for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate, unless she know why she ought to be virtuous?  Unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good?  If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations.  In this work I have produced many arguments, which to me were conclusive, to prove, that the prevailing notion respecting a sexual character was subversive of morality, and I have contended, that to render the human body and mind more perfect, chastity must more universally prevail, and that chastity will never be respected in the male world till the person of a woman is not, as it were, idolized when little virtue or sense embellish it with the grand traces of mental beauty, or the interesting simplicity of affection.  Consider, Sir, dispassionately, these observations, for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, ""that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it was impossible to explain."" If so, on what does your constitution rest?  If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman, prescription.  Consider, I address you as a legislator, whether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves, respecting their own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift of reason?  In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be useful.  Do you not act a similar part, when you FORCE all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark? For surely, sir, you will not assert, that a duty can be binding which is not founded on reason? If, indeed, this be their destination, arguments may be drawn from reason; and thus augustly supported, the more understanding women acquire, the more they will be attached to their duty, comprehending it, for unless they comprehend it, unless their morals be fixed on the same immutable principles as those of man, no authority can make them discharge it in a virtuous manner.  They may be convenient slaves, but slavery will have its constant effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.  But, if women are to be excluded, without having a voice, from a participation of the natural rights of mankind, prove first, to ward off the charge of injustice and inconsistency, that they want reason, else this flaw in your NEW CONSTITUTION, the first constitution founded on reason, will ever show that man must, in some shape, act like a tyrant, and tyranny, in whatever part of society it rears its brazen front, will ever undermine morality.  I have repeatedly asserted, and produced what appeared to me irrefragable arguments drawn from matters of fact, to prove my assertion, that women cannot, by force, be confined to domestic concerns; for they will however ignorant, intermeddle with more weighty affairs, neglecting private duties only to disturb, by cunning tricks, the orderly plans of reason which rise above their comprehension.  Besides, whilst they are only made to acquire personal accomplishments, men will seek for pleasure in variety, and faithless husbands will make faithless wives; such ignorant beings, indeed, will be very excusable when, not taught to respect public good, nor allowed any civil right, they attempt to do themselves justice by retaliation.  The box of mischief thus opened in society, what is to preserve private virtue, the only security of public freedom and universal happiness?  Let there be then no coercion ESTABLISHED in society, and the common law of gravity prevailing, the sexes will fall into their proper places.  And, now that more equitable laws are forming your citizens, marriage may become more sacred; your young men may choose wives from motives of affection, and your maidens allow love to root out vanity.  The father of a family will not then weaken his constitution and debase his sentiments, by visiting the harlot, nor forget, in obeying the call of appetite, the purpose for which it was implanted; and the mother will not neglect her children to practise the arts of coquetry, when sense and modesty secure her the friendship of her husband.  But, till men become attentive to the duty of a father, it is vain to expect women to spend that time in their nursery which they, ""wise in their generation,"" choose to spend at their glass; for this exertion of cunning is only an instinct of nature to enable them to obtain indirectly a little of that power of which they are unjustly denied a share; for, if women are not permitted to enjoy legitimate rights, they will render both men and themselves vicious, to obtain illicit privileges.  I wish, sir, to set some investigations of this kind afloat in France; and should they lead to a confirmation of my principles, when your constitution is revised, the rights of woman may be respected, if it be fully proved that reason calls for this respect, and loudly demands JUSTICE for one half of the human race.  I am, sir,  Yours respectfully,  M. W.   INTRODUCTION.  After considering the historic page, and viewing the living world with anxious solicitude, the most melancholy emotions of sorrowful indignation have depressed my spirits, and I have sighed when obliged to confess, that either nature has made a great difference between man and man, or that the civilization, which has hitherto taken place in the world, has been very partial.  I have turned over various books written on the subject of education, and patiently observed the conduct of parents and the management of schools; but what has been the result? a profound conviction, that the neglected education of my fellow creatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore; and that women in particular, are rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes, originating from one hasty conclusion.  The conduct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove, that their minds are not in a healthy state; for, like the flowers that  are planted in too rich a soil, strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty; and the flaunting leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived at maturity.  One cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men, who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than rational wives; and the understanding of the sex has been so bubbled by this specious homage, that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect.  In a treatise, therefore, on female rights and manners, the works which have been particularly written for their improvement must not be overlooked; especially when it is asserted, in direct terms, that the minds of women are enfeebled by false refinement; that the books of instruction, written by men of genius, have had the same tendency as more frivolous productions; and that, in the true style of Mahometanism, they are only considered as females, and not as a part of the human species, when improvable reason is allowed to be the dignified distinction, which raises men above the brute creation, and puts a natural sceptre in a feeble hand.  Yet, because I am a woman, I would not lead my readers to suppose, that I mean violently to agitate the contested question respecting the equality and inferiority of the sex; but as the subject lies in my way, and I cannot pass it over without subjecting the main tendency of my reasoning to misconstruction, I shall stop a moment to deliver, in a few words, my opinion.  In the government of the physical world, it is observable that the female, in general, is inferior to the male.  The male pursues, the female yields--this is the law of nature; and it does not appear to be suspended or abrogated in favour of woman.  This physical superiority cannot be denied--and it is a noble prerogative!  But not content with this natural pre-eminence, men endeavour to sink us still lower, merely to render us alluring objects for a moment; and women, intoxicated by the adoration which men, under the influence of their senses, pay them, do not seek to obtain a durable interest in their hearts, or to become the friends of the fellow creatures who find amusement in their society.  I am aware of an obvious inference: from every quarter have I heard exclamations against masculine women; but where are they to be found?  If, by this appellation, men mean to inveigh against their ardour in hunting, shooting, and gaming, I shall most cordially join in the cry; but if it be, against the imitation of manly virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of those talents and virtues, the exercise of which ennobles the human character, and which raise females in the scale of animal being, when they are comprehensively termed mankind--all those who view them with a philosophical eye must, I should think, wish with me, that they may every day grow more and more masculine.  This discussion naturally divides the subject.  I shall first consider women in the grand light of human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed on this earth to unfold their faculties; and afterwards I shall more particularly point out their peculiar designation.  I wish also to steer clear of an error, which many respectable writers have fallen into; for the instruction which has hitherto been addressed to women, has rather been applicable to LADIES, if the little indirect advice, that is scattered through Sandford and Merton, be excepted; but, addressing my sex in a firmer tone, I pay particular attention to those in the middle class, because they appear to be in the most natural state.  Perhaps the seeds of false refinement, immorality, and vanity have ever been shed by the great.  Weak, artificial beings raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner, undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society!  As a class of mankind they have the strongest claim to pity! the education of the rich tends to render them vain and helpless, and the unfolding mind is not strengthened by the practice of those duties which dignify the human character.  They only live to amuse themselves, and by the same law which in nature invariably produces certain effects, they soon only afford barren amusement.  But as I purpose taking a separate view of the different ranks of society, and of the moral character of women, in each, this hint is, for the present, sufficient; and I have only alluded to the subject, because it appears to me to be the very essence of an introduction to give a cursory account of the contents of the work it introduces.  My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their FASCINATING graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.  I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists--I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them, that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.  Dismissing then those pretty feminine phrases, which the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish dependence, and despising that weak elegancy of mind, exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners, supposed to be the sexual characteristics of the weaker vessel, I wish to show that elegance is inferior to virtue, that the first object of laudable ambition is to obtain a character as a human being, regardless of the distinction of sex; and that secondary views should be brought to this simple touchstone.  This is a rough sketch of my plan; and should I express my conviction with the energetic emotions that I feel whenever I think of the subject, the dictates of experience and reflection will be felt by some of my readers.  Animated by this important object, I shall disdain to cull my phrases or polish my style--I aim at being useful, and sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather to persuade by the force of my arguments, than dazzle by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my time in rounding periods, nor in fabricating the turgid bombast of artificial feelings, which, coming from the head, never reach the heart.  I shall be employed about things, not words! and, anxious to render my sex more respectable members of society, I shall try to avoid that flowery diction which has slided from essays into novels, and from novels into familiar letters and conversation.  These pretty nothings, these caricatures of the real beauty of sensibility, dropping glibly from the tongue, vitiate the taste, and create a kind of sickly delicacy that turns away from simple unadorned truth; and a deluge of false sentiments and over-stretched feelings, stifling the natural emotions of the heart, render the domestic pleasures insipid, that ought to sweeten the exercise of those severe duties, which educate a rational and immortal being for a nobler field of action.  The education of women has, of late, been more attended to than formerly; yet they are still reckoned a frivolous sex, and ridiculed or pitied by the writers who endeavour by satire or instruction to improve them.  It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering of accomplishments:  meanwhile, strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty, to the desire of establishing themselves, the only way women can rise in the world--by marriage.  And this desire making mere animals of them, when they marry, they act as such children may be expected to act: they dress; they paint, and nickname God's creatures.  Surely these weak beings are only fit for the seraglio!  Can they govern a family, or take care of the poor babes whom they bring into the world?  If then it can be fairly deduced from the present conduct of the sex, from the prevalent fondness for pleasure, which takes place of ambition and those nobler passions that open and enlarge the soul; that the instruction which women have received has only tended, with the constitution of civil society, to render them insignificant objects of desire; mere propagators of fools! if it can be proved, that in aiming to accomplish them, without cultivating their understandings, they are taken out of their sphere of duties, and made ridiculous and useless when the short lived bloom of beauty is over*, I presume that RATIONAL men will excuse me for endeavouring to persuade them to become more masculine and respectable.  (*Footnote.  A lively writer, I cannot recollect his name, asks what business women turned of forty have to do in the world.)  Indeed the word masculine is only a bugbear:  there is little reason to fear that women will acquire too much courage or fortitude; for their apparent inferiority with respect to bodily strength, must render them, in some degree, dependent on men in the various relations of life; but why should it be increased by prejudices that give a sex to virtue, and confound simple truths with sensual reveries?  Women are, in fact, so much degraded by mistaken notions of female excellence, that I do not mean to add a paradox when I assert, that this artificial weakness produces a propensity to tyrannize, and gives birth to cunning, the natural opponent of strength, which leads them to play off those contemptible infantile airs that undermine esteem even whilst they excite desire.  Do not foster these prejudices, and they will naturally fall into their subordinate, yet respectable station in life.  It seems scarcely necessary to say, that I now speak of the sex in general.  Many individuals have more sense than their male relatives; and, as nothing preponderates where there is a constant struggle for an equilibrium, without it has naturally more gravity, some women govern their husbands without degrading themselves, because intellect will always govern.   VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN.   CHAPTER 1.  THE RIGHTS AND INVOLVED DUTIES OF MANKIND CONSIDERED.  In the present state of society, it appears necessary to go back to first principles in search of the most simple truths, and to dispute with some prevailing prejudice every inch of ground.  To clear my way, I must be allowed to ask some plain questions, and the answers will probably appear as unequivocal as the axioms on which reasoning is built; though, when entangled with various motives of action, they are formally contradicted, either by the words or conduct of men.  In what does man's pre-eminence over the brute creation consist? The answer is as clear as that a half is less than the whole; in Reason.  What acquirement exalts one being above another?  Virtue; we spontaneously reply.  For what purpose were the passions implanted?  That man by struggling with them might attain a degree of knowledge denied to the brutes:  whispers Experience.  Consequently the perfection of our nature and capability of happiness, must be estimated by the degree of reason, virtue, and knowledge, that distinguish the individual, and direct the laws which bind society:  "

It is an ancient Mariner,      And he stoppeth one of three.      ""By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,      Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?       ""The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,      And I am next of kin;      The guests are met, the feast is set:      May'st hear the merry din.""       He holds him with his skinny hand,      ""There was a ship,"" quoth he.      ""Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!""      Eftsoons his hand dropt he.       He holds him with his glittering eye--      The Wedding-Guest stood still,      And listens like a three years child:      The Mariner hath his will.       The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:      He cannot chuse but hear;      And thus spake on that ancient man,      The bright-eyed Mariner.       The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,      Merrily did we drop      Below the kirk, below the hill,      Below the light-house top.       The Sun came up upon the left,      Out of the sea came he!      And he shone bright, and on the right      Went down into the sea.       Higher and higher every day,      Till over the mast at noon--      The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,      For he heard the loud bassoon.       The bride hath paced into the hall,      Red as a rose is she;      Nodding their heads before her goes      The merry minstrelsy.       The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,      Yet he cannot chuse but hear;      And thus spake on that ancient man,      The bright-eyed Mariner.       And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he      Was tyrannous and strong:      He struck with his o'ertaking wings,      And chased south along.       With sloping masts and dipping prow,      As who pursued with yell and blow      Still treads the shadow of his foe      And forward bends his head,      The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,      And southward aye we fled.       And now there came both mist and snow,      And it grew wondrous cold:      And ice, mast-high, came floating by,      As green as emerald.       And through the drifts the snowy clifts      Did send a dismal sheen:      Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--      The ice was all between.       The ice was here, the ice was there,      The ice was all around:      It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,      Like noises in a swound!       At length did cross an Albatross:      Thorough the fog it came;      As if it had been a Christian soul,      We hailed it in God's name.       It ate the food it ne'er had eat,      And round and round it flew.      The ice did split with a thunder-fit;      The helmsman steered us through!       And a good south wind sprung up behind;      The Albatross did follow,      And every day, for food or play,      Came to the mariners' hollo!       In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,      It perched for vespers nine;      Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,      Glimmered the white Moon-shine.       ""God save thee, ancient Mariner!      From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--      Why look'st thou so?""--With my cross-bow      I shot the ALBATROSS.     PART THE SECOND.       The Sun now rose upon the right:      Out of the sea came he,      Still hid in mist, and on the left      Went down into the sea.       And the good south wind still blew behind      But no sweet bird did follow,      Nor any day for food or play      Came to the mariners' hollo!       And I had done an hellish thing,      And it would work 'em woe:      For all averred, I had killed the bird      That made the breeze to blow.      Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay      That made the breeze to blow!       Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,      The glorious Sun uprist:      Then all averred, I had killed the bird      That brought the fog and mist.      'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,      That bring the fog and mist.       The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,      The furrow followed free:      We were the first that ever burst      Into that silent sea.       Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,      'Twas sad as sad could be;      And we did speak only to break      The silence of the sea!       All in a hot and copper sky,      The bloody Sun, at noon,      Right up above the mast did stand,      No bigger than the Moon.       Day after day, day after day,      We stuck, nor breath nor motion;      As idle as a painted ship      Upon a painted ocean.       Water, water, every where,      And all the boards did shrink;      Water, water, every where,      Nor any drop to drink.       The very deep did rot: O Christ!      That ever this should be!      Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs      Upon the slimy sea.       About, about, in reel and rout      The death-fires danced at night;      The water, like a witch's oils,      Burnt green, and blue and white.       And some in dreams assured were      Of the spirit that plagued us so:      Nine fathom deep he had followed us      From the land of mist and snow.       And every tongue, through utter drought,      Was withered at the root;      We could not speak, no more than if      We had been choked with soot.       Ah! well a-day! what evil looks      Had I from old and young!      Instead of the cross, the Albatross      About my neck was hung.     PART THE THIRD.       There passed a weary time.  Each throat      Was parched, and glazed each eye.      A weary time! a weary time!      How glazed each weary eye,      When looking westward, I beheld      A something in the sky.       At first it seemed a little speck,      And then it seemed a mist:      It moved and moved, and took at last      A certain shape, I wist.       A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!      And still it neared and neared:      As if it dodged a water-sprite,      It plunged and tacked and veered.       With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,      We could not laugh nor wail;      Through utter drought all dumb we stood!      I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,      And cried, A sail! a sail!       With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,      Agape they heard me call:      Gramercy! they for joy did grin,      And all at once their breath drew in,      As they were drinking all.       See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!      Hither to work us weal;      Without a breeze, without a tide,      She steadies with upright keel!       The western wave was all a-flame      The day was well nigh done!      Almost upon the western wave      Rested the broad bright Sun;      When that strange shape drove suddenly      Betwixt us and the Sun.       And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,      (Heaven's Mother send us grace!)      As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,      With broad and burning face.       Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)      How fast she nears and nears!      Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,      Like restless gossameres!       Are those her ribs through which the Sun      Did peer, as through a grate?      And is that Woman all her crew?      Is that a DEATH? and are there two?      Is DEATH that woman's mate?       Her lips were red, her looks were free,      Her locks were yellow as gold:      Her skin was as white as leprosy,      The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,      Who thicks man's blood with cold.       The naked hulk alongside came,      And the twain were casting dice;      ""The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!""      Quoth she, and whistles thrice.       The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:      At one stride comes the dark;      With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.      Off shot the spectre-bark.       We listened and looked sideways up!      Fear at my heart, as at a cup,      My life-blood seemed to sip!       The stars were dim, and thick the night,      The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;      From the sails the dew did drip--      Till clombe above the eastern bar      The horned Moon, with one bright star      Within the nether tip.       One after one, by the star-dogged Moon      Too quick for groan or sigh,      Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,      And cursed me with his eye.       Four times fifty living men,      (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)      With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,      They dropped down one by one.       The souls did from their bodies fly,--      They fled to bliss or woe!      And every soul, it passed me by,      Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!     PART THE FOURTH.       ""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!      I fear thy skinny hand!      And thou art long, and lank, and brown,      As is the ribbed sea-sand.       ""I fear thee and thy glittering eye,      And thy skinny hand, so brown.""--      Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!      This body dropt not down.       Alone, alone, all, all alone,      Alone on a wide wide sea!      And never a saint took pity on      My soul in agony.       The many men, so beautiful!      And they all dead did lie:      And a thousand thousand slimy things      Lived on; and so did I.       I looked upon the rotting sea,      And drew my eyes away;      I looked upon the rotting deck,      And there the dead men lay.       I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:      But or ever a prayer had gusht,      A wicked whisper came, and made      my heart as dry as dust.       I closed my lids, and kept them close,      And the balls like pulses beat;      For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky      Lay like a load on my weary eye,      And the dead were at my feet.       The cold sweat melted from their limbs,      Nor rot nor reek did they:      The look with which they looked on me      Had never passed away.       An orphan's curse would drag to Hell      A spirit from on high;      But oh! more horrible than that      Is a curse in a dead man's eye!      Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,      And yet I could not die.       The moving Moon went up the sky,      And no where did abide:      Softly she was going up,      And a star or two beside.       Her beams bemocked the sultry main,      Like April hoar-frost spread;      But where the ship's huge shadow lay,      The charmed water burnt alway      A still and awful red.       Beyond the shadow of the ship,      I watched the water-snakes:      They moved in tracks of shining white,      And when they reared, the elfish light      Fell off in hoary flakes.       Within the shadow of the ship      I watched their rich attire:      Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,      They coiled and swam; and every track      Was a flash of golden fire.       O happy living things! no tongue      Their beauty might declare:      A spring of love gushed from my heart,      And I blessed them unaware:      Sure my kind saint took pity on me,      And I blessed them unaware.       The self same moment I could pray;      And from my neck so free      The Albatross fell off, and sank      Like lead into the sea.     PART THE FIFTH.       Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,      Beloved from pole to pole!      To Mary Queen the praise be given!      She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,      That slid into my soul.       The silly buckets on the deck,      That had so long remained,      I dreamt that they were filled with dew;      And when I awoke, it rained.       My lips were wet, my throat was cold,      My garments all were dank;      Sure I had drunken in my dreams,      And still my body drank.       I moved, and could not feel my limbs:      I was so light--almost      I thought that I had died in sleep,      And was a blessed ghost.       And soon I heard a roaring wind:      It did not come anear;      But with its sound it shook the sails,      That were so thin and sere.       The upper air burst into life!      And a hundred fire-flags sheen,      To and fro they were hurried about!      And to and fro, and in and out,      The wan stars danced between.       And the coming wind did roar more loud,      And the sails did sigh like sedge;      And the rain poured down from one black cloud;      The Moon was at its edge.       The thick black cloud was cleft, and still      The Moon was at its side:      Like waters shot from some high crag,      The lightning fell with never a jag,      A river steep and wide.       The loud wind never reached the ship,      Yet now the ship moved on!      Beneath the lightning and the Moon      The dead men gave a groan.       They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,      Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;      It had been strange, even in a dream,      To have seen those dead men rise.       The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;      Yet never a breeze up blew;      The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,      Where they were wont to do:      They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--      We were a ghastly crew.       The body of my brother's son,      Stood by me, knee to knee:      The body and I pulled at one rope,      But he said nought to me.       ""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!""      Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!      'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,      Which to their corses came again,      But a troop of spirits blest:       For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,      And clustered round the mast;      Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,      And from their bodies passed.       Around, around, flew each sweet sound,      Then darted to the Sun;      Slowly the sounds came back again,      Now mixed, now one by one.       Sometimes a-dropping from the sky      I heard the sky-lark sing;      Sometimes all little birds that are,      How they seemed to fill the sea and air      With their sweet jargoning!       And now 'twas like all instruments,      Now like a lonely flute;      And now it is an angel's song,      That makes the Heavens be mute.       It ceased; yet still the sails made on      A pleasant noise till noon,      A noise like of a hidden brook      In the leafy month of June,      That to the sleeping woods all night      Singeth a quiet tune.       Till noon we quietly sailed on,      Yet never a breeze did breathe:      Slowly and smoothly went the ship,      Moved onward from beneath.       Under the keel nine fathom deep,      From the land of mist and snow,      The spirit slid: and it was he      That made the ship to go.      The sails at noon left off their tune,      And the ship stood still also.       The Sun, right up above the mast,      Had fixed her to the ocean:      But in a minute she 'gan stir,      With a short uneasy motion--      Backwards and forwards half her length      With a short uneasy motion.       Then like a pawing horse let go,      She made a sudden bound:      It flung the blood into my head,      And I fell down in a swound.       How long in that same fit I lay,      I have not to declare;      But ere my living life returned,      I heard and in my soul discerned      Two VOICES in the air.       ""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?      By him who died on cross,      With his cruel bow he laid full low,      The harmless Albatross.       ""The spirit who bideth by himself      In the land of mist and snow,      He loved the bird that loved the man      Who shot him with his bow.""       The other was a softer voice,      As soft as honey-dew:      Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done,      And penance more will do.""     PART THE SIXTH.        FIRST VOICE.       But tell me, tell me! speak again,      Thy soft response renewing--      What makes that ship drive on so fast?      What is the OCEAN doing?        SECOND VOICE.       Still as a slave before his lord,      The OCEAN hath no blast;      His great bright eye most silently      Up to the Moon is cast--       If he may know which way to go;      For she guides him smooth or grim      See, brother, see! how graciously      She looketh down on him.        FIRST VOICE.       But why drives on that ship so fast,      Without or wave or wind?        SECOND VOICE.       The air is cut away before,      And closes from behind.       Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high      Or we shall be belated:      For slow and slow that ship will go,      When the Mariner's trance is abated.       I woke, and we were sailing on      As in a gentle weather:      'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;      The dead men stood together.       All stood together on the deck,      For a charnel-dungeon fitter:      All fixed on me their stony eyes,      That in the Moon did glitter.       The pang, the curse, with which they died,      Had never passed away:      I could not draw my eyes from theirs,      Nor turn them up to pray.       And now this spell was snapt: once more      I viewed the ocean green.      And looked far forth, yet little saw      Of what had else been seen--       Like one that on a lonesome road      Doth walk in fear and dread,      And having once turned round walks on,      And turns no more his head;      Because he knows, a frightful fiend      Doth close behind him tread.       But soon there breathed a wind on me,      Nor sound nor motion made:      Its path was not upon the sea,      In ripple or in shade.       It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek      Like a meadow-gale of spring--      It mingled strangely with my fears,      Yet it felt like a welcoming.       Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,      Yet she sailed softly too:      Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--      On me alone it blew.       Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed      The light-house top I see?      Is this the hill? is this the kirk?      Is this mine own countree!       We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,      And I with sobs did pray--      O let me be awake, my God!      Or let me sleep alway.       The harbour-bay was clear as glass,      So smoothly it was strewn!      And on the bay the moonlight lay,      And the shadow of the moon.       The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,      That stands above the rock:      The moonlight steeped in silentness      The steady weathercock.       And the bay was white with silent light,      Till rising from the same,      Full many shapes, that shadows were,      In crimson colours came.       A little distance from the prow      Those crimson shadows were:      I turned my eyes upon the deck--      Oh, Christ! what saw I there!       Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,      And, by the holy rood!      A man all light, a seraph-man,      On every corse there stood.       This seraph band, each waved his hand:      It was a heavenly sight!      They stood as signals to the land,      Each one a lovely light:       This seraph-band, each waved his hand,      No voice did they impart--      No voice; but oh! the silence sank      Like music on my heart.       But soon I heard the dash of oars;      I heard the Pilot's cheer;      My head was turned perforce away,      And I saw a boat appear.       The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,      I heard them coming fast:      Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy      The dead men could not blast.       I saw a third--I heard his voice:      It is the Hermit good!      He singeth loud his godly hymns      That he makes in the wood.      He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away      The Albatross's blood.     PART THE SEVENTH.       This Hermit good lives in that wood      Which slopes down to the sea.      How loudly his sweet voice he rears!      He loves to talk with marineres      That come from a far countree.       He kneels at morn and noon and eve--      He hath a cushion plump:      It is the moss that wholly hides      The rotted old oak-stump.       The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,      ""Why this is strange, I trow!      Where are those lights so many and fair,      That signal made but now?""       ""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--      ""And they answered not our cheer!      The planks looked warped! and see those sails,      How thin they are and sere!      I never saw aught like to them,      Unless perchance it were       ""Brown skeletons of leaves that lag      My forest-brook along;      When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,      And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,      That eats the she-wolf's young.""       ""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--      (The Pilot made reply)      I am a-feared""--""Push on, push on!""      Said the Hermit cheerily.       The boat came closer to the ship,      But I nor spake nor stirred;      The boat came close beneath the ship,      And straight a sound was heard.       Under the water it rumbled on,      Still louder and more dread:      It reached the ship, it split the bay;      The ship went down like lead.       Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,      Which sky and ocean smote,      Like one that hath been seven days drowned      My body lay afloat;      But swift as dreams, myself I found      Within the Pilot's boat.       Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,      The boat spun round and round;      And all was still, save that the hill      Was telling of the sound.       I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked      And fell down in a fit;      The holy Hermit raised his eyes,      And prayed where he did sit.       I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,      Who now doth crazy go,      Laughed loud and long, and all the while      His eyes went to and fro.      ""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see,      The Devil knows how to row.""       And now, all in my own countree,      I stood on the firm land!      The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,      And scarcely he could stand.       ""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!""      The Hermit crossed his brow.      ""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say--      What manner of man art thou?""       Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched      With a woeful agony,      Which forced me to begin my tale;      And then it left me free.       Since then, at an uncertain hour,      That agony returns;      And till my ghastly tale is told,      This heart within me burns.       I pass, like night, from land to land;      I have strange power of speech;      That moment that his face I see,      I know the man that must hear me:      To him my tale I teach.       What loud uproar bursts from that door!      The wedding-guests are there:      But in the garden-bower the bride      And bride-maids singing are:      And hark the little vesper bell,      Which biddeth me to prayer!       O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been      Alone on a wide wide sea:      So lonely 'twas, that God himself      Scarce seemed there to be.       O sweeter than the marriage-feast,      'Tis sweeter far to me,      To walk together to the kirk      With a goodly company!--       To walk together to the kirk,      And all together pray,      While each to his great Father bends,      Old men, and babes, and loving friends,      And youths and maidens gay!       Farewell, farewell! but this I tell      To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!      He prayeth well, who loveth well      Both man and bird and beast.       He prayeth best, who loveth best      All things both great and small;      For the dear God who loveth us      He made and loveth all.       The Mariner, whose eye is bright,      Whose beard with age is hoar,      Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest      Turned from the bridegroom's door.       He went like one that hath been stunned,      And is of sense forlorn:      A sadder and a wiser man,      He rose the morrow morn.        *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER ***         Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.

To the Honourable  GEORGE LYTTLETON, ESQ;  One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.  Sir,  Notwithstanding your constant refusal, when I have asked leave to prefix your name to this dedication, I must still insist on my right to desire your protection of this work.  To you, Sir, it is owing that this history was ever begun. It was by your desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years have since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this circumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands; and the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.  Again, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been completed. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw on you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than that I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time which I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be necessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which you are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall always have a better memory than yourself.  Lastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If there be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger picture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other, who that knows you, and a particular acquaintance of yours, will doubt whence that benevolence hath been copied? The world will not, I believe, make me the compliment of thinking I took it from myself. I care not: this they shall own, that the two persons from whom I have taken it, that is to say, two of the best and worthiest men in the world, are strongly and zealously my friends. I might be contented with this, and yet my vanity will add a third to the number; and him one of the greatest and noblest, not only in his rank, but in every public and private virtue. But here, whilst my gratitude for the princely benefactions of the Duke of Bedford bursts from my heart, you must forgive my reminding you that it was you who first recommended me to the notice of my benefactor.  And what are your objections to the allowance of the honour which I have sollicited? Why, you have commended the book so warmly, that you should be ashamed of reading your name before the dedication. Indeed, sir, if the book itself doth not make you ashamed of your commendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not to give up my right to your protection and patronage, because you have commended my book: for though I acknowledge so many obligations to you, I do not add this to the number; in which friendship, I am convinced, hath so little share: since that can neither biass your judgment, nor pervert your integrity. An enemy may at any time obtain your commendation by only deserving it; and the utmost which the faults of your friends can hope for, is your silence; or, perhaps, if too severely accused, your gentle palliation.  In short, sir, I suspect, that your dislike of public praise is your true objection to granting my request. I have observed that you have, in common with my two other friends, an unwillingness to hear the least mention of your own virtues; that, as a great poet says of one of you, (he might justly have said it of all three), you       _Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame_.  If men of this disposition are as careful to shun applause, as others are to escape censure, how just must be your apprehension of your character falling into my hands; since what would not a man have reason to dread, if attacked by an author who had received from him injuries equal to my obligations to you!  And will not this dread of censure increase in proportion to the matter which a man is conscious of having afforded for it? If his whole life, for instance, should have been one continued subject of satire, he may well tremble when an incensed satirist takes him in hand. Now, sir, if we apply this to your modest aversion to panegyric, how reasonable will your fears of me appear!  Yet surely you might have gratified my ambition, from this single confidence, that I shall always prefer the indulgence of your inclinations to the satisfaction of my own. A very strong instance of which I shall give you in this address, in which I am determined to follow the example of all other dedicators, and will consider not what my patron really deserves to have written, but what he will be best pleased to read.  Without further preface then, I here present you with the labours of some years of my life. What merit these labours have is already known to yourself. If, from your favourable judgment, I have conceived some esteem for them, it cannot be imputed to vanity; since I should have agreed as implicitly to your opinion, had it been given in favour of any other man's production. Negatively, at least, I may be allowed to say, that had I been sensible of any great demerit in the work, you are the last person to whose protection I would have ventured to recommend it.  From the name of my patron, indeed, I hope my reader will be convinced, at his very entrance on this work, that he will find in the whole course of it nothing prejudicial to the cause of religion and virtue, nothing inconsistent with the strictest rules of decency, nor which can offend even the chastest eye in the perusal. On the contrary, I declare, that to recommend goodness and innocence hath been my sincere endeavour in this history. This honest purpose you have been pleased to think I have attained: and to say the truth, it is likeliest to be attained in books of this kind; for an example is a kind of picture, in which virtue becomes, as it were, an object of sight, and strikes us with an idea of that loveliness, which Plato asserts there is in her naked charms.  Besides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the admiration of mankind, I have attempted to engage a stronger motive to human action in her favour, by convincing men, that their true interest directs them to a pursuit of her. For this purpose I have shown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that solid inward comfort of mind, which is the sure companion of innocence and virtue; nor can in the least balance the evil of that horror and anxiety which, in their room, guilt introduces into our bosoms. And again, that as these acquisitions are in themselves generally worthless, so are the means to attain them not only base and infamous, but at best incertain, and always full of danger. Lastly, I have endeavoured strongly to inculcate, that virtue and innocence can scarce ever be injured but by indiscretion; and that it is this alone which often betrays them into the snares that deceit and villainy spread for them. A moral which I have the more industriously laboured, as the teaching it is, of all others, the likeliest to be attended with success; since, I believe, it is much easier to make good men wise, than to make bad men good.  For these purposes I have employed all the wit and humour of which I am master in the following history; wherein I have endeavoured to laugh mankind out of their favourite follies and vices. How far I have succeeded in this good attempt, I shall submit to the candid reader, with only two requests: First, that he will not expect to find perfection in this work; and Secondly, that he will excuse some parts of it, if they fall short of that little merit which I hope may appear in others.  I will detain you, sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a preface, while I professed to write a dedication. But how can it be otherwise? I dare not praise you; and the only means I know of to avoid it, when you are in my thoughts, are either to be entirely silent, or to turn my thoughts to some other subject.  Pardon, therefore, what I have said in this epistle, not only without your consent, but absolutely against it; and give me at least leave, in this public manner, to declare that I am, with the highest respect and gratitude,--  Sir,  Your most obliged,  Obedient, humble servant,  HENRY FIELDING.      THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.     BOOK I.  CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.    Chapter i.  The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.   An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their dinner without controul.  To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other ordinary better accommodated to their taste.  As we do not "
