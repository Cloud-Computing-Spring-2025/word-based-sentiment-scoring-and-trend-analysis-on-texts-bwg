minute gan stir short uneasy motion backwards forwards half her length short uneasy motion then like pawing horse let go made sudden bound flung blood into my head fell down swound how long same fit lay have not declare but ere my living life returned heard my soul discerned two voices air quoth one man him who died cross cruel bow laid full low harmless albatross spirit who bideth himself land
